The researcher assessed what was previously known regarding the question of whether MNC employees should get CCC training through the utilization of a systematic review approach to search, as well as judgmentally appraise, the then-available literature. Notably, rapid reviews are as well christened rapid evidence assessments, rapid evidence summaries, expedited reviews, rapid evidence reviews, and rapid systematic reviews (Dobbins 4-7). The researcher synthesized information or evidence from different sources, providing rather timely findings related to the question. Rapid reviews hasten processes of systematic reviews through the omission of some systematic review stages – that elementarily portends that rapid reviews are not as rigorous as the typical systematic reviews. 
                            In the research, the researcher followed various steps. First, the researcher planned the review by firming up the research question that was to form the foundation of the research - the question of whether MNC employees should get CCC training. Second, the researcher looked for relevant literature from different sources, including particular books and websites. Third, the researcher analyzed the literature – results. Fourth, the researcher synthesized or assessed findings from the different sources that were considered in the research.

All cultures have specific rules that those hosted by the cultures may ignore or assume. Many people are ignorant about their cultural biases or prejudices since cultural imprinting commences when people are still very young. Notably, some aspects of culture are taught to people explicitly. Such aspects include anxieties, beliefs, knowledge, values, and phobias or fears (Cross Cultural Communications International, Inc. 1-2). As MNCs' workforces become more and more diverse, employees from different cultures have different appreciations of the aspects and the related dynamics. As such, the employees are likely to be distrustful and afraid of each other. As such, it is quite clear that "lack of knowledge of another culture can lead, at the best, to embarrassing or amusing mistakes in communication" (Zink et al., para.10). The mistakes are highly likely to "confuse or even offend the people we wish to communicate with" (Zink et al., para.10).
                            On the other hand, there are other aspects of culture that people naturally absorb subconsciously and unintentionally over time. MNCs are facing increasing CCC challenges with every succeeding day as their workforces are becoming more and more diverse. People from different cultures communicate or respond differently and unintentionally. As such, many MNCs' employees are likely to be afraid of relating to employees from cultures that are "different from their own," and their "fears usually include being judged, miscommunication, and patronizing or hurting others unintentionally" (DuPraw and Axner, para.1). communications pitting MNCs' employees from particular cultures against other employees are likely to be bogged down by misunderstandings and patronizing attitudes, which make communications ineffective.

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">The term globalization is typically utilized in describing or explaining the growing interdependence, as well as connectedness, of world economies and cultures and the growth of global business (Cross Cultural Communications International, Inc. 1-2). The continuing growth of MNCs is typified by the growing flow of business ideas, people, capital, services, as well as goods globally. Notably, direct foreign investments (DFIs) by MNCs have kept growing in recent times. For instance, the DFI of MNCs "grew from $9 trillion in 1966 to more than $300 trillion in 2002" (Zink et al., para.2). indeed, "many products we assume are American, such as Purina Dog Chow and KitKat candy bars, are made overseas" (para.2). By and large, a host country culture or "THC is significant and positively related to" cross-cultural communication or "CCC (b ¼ 0.31, t ¼ 5.05, p < 0.001) of expatriates which is necessary for their successful business operations" (Abugre and Debrah 98). 
                            Elementarily, "the increasing internationalization of business calls for ... increased ... focus on the critical role of cross-cultural communication competence" (85-86). That portends that as businesses grow or expand in pursuit of more and more profits and revenue, they should ensure that their employees from diverse cultural backgrounds get the requisite CCC training. Just like other businesses, effective communications help MNCs "to control and coordinate their distributed operations" effectively (88). A person communicates effectively with others from different cultures if he or she has a good understanding of the culture. As such, one needs CCC training to become an effective cross-cultural communicator. 
                            MNCs should facilitate their employees to get the requisite CCC training so that they become effective when with employees from other cultures. Even when employees from different cultures have conflicting values, CCC training helps them live with the conflicting values easily. Failure to take MNC employees through CCC training makes them continue to "misunderstand each other and react in ways that can hinder what are otherwise promising partnerships" (DuPraw and Axner, para.7). MNC employees with the requisite CCC training are unlikely to make embarrassing mistakes when communicating with others. MNC employees with the requisite CCC training are unlikely to make funny mistakes when communicating with others. MNC employees with the requisite CCC training are unlikely to offend others when communicating with them. If MNCs fail to take their diverse workforces through the requisite CCC training, their "conclusion of business deals or international agreements" remains markedly "difficult or impossible" (Zink et al., para.10).
