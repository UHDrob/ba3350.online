The research was executed or conducted using a rapid systematic review approach. The research showed that as regards MNCs, communicating across different cultures is quite challenging and that those working for MNCs should get the required CCC training. Ideally, MNCs should provide their diverse workforces with the requisite CCC training. </p>

                            <p class="mb-0">The number of people working away from their mother countries and cultures – expatriates – has kept on growing over the years, as shown in this report's Appendix (Finaccord, fig.2). The term cross-cultural communication (CCC) is typically utilized when referring to communication between individuals of different orientations, for instance, different sexual orientations, genders, races, ethnicities, ages, working styles, and nationalities (Cross Cultural Communications International, Inc. 1-2; Dima 3-4). The term CCC is as well commonly utilized in referring to the varied efforts aimed at mediating, negotiating, and exchanging cultural divides or differences through well-thought-out uses of specific body language, gestures, and languages. CCC is how individuals who do not share the same cultures communicate among themselves. It is widely thought that professionals and businesspersons can only thrive in international business if they have or develop a good appreciation and understanding of the specific cultural nuances, practices, as well as values, defining specific regions (Alatis 5-8; Penrose et al. 5-6). As such, CCC training and awareness appear to be rather important. There is widespread thinking that CCC training is capable of fostering the development or engendering of CCC skills and leading to improved staff performance when engaged in international assignments. There is widespread thinking that being adept at CCC enhances how one relates with his or her host countries' nationals and makes it easy for them to adjust fast enough to their host cultures (Mandal 10-12). This report presents the findings of specific research that was aimed at establishing the CCC challenges faced by multinational corporations (MNCs) and the reasons why MNCs should develop CCC training programs for their stakeholders.  </p>
