                            MNCs should provide their diverse workforces with CCC training. Owing to globalization or internationalization of MNCs' business activities and operations, they open up and present numerous job opportunities globally. Their employees are usually hired from varied cultures and countries – their workforces are usually markedly diversified (Cross Cultural Communications International, Inc. 6-8). Developing CCC training programs and having their workforces go through them helps MNCs' management teams to deal effectively with their diversified workforces to realize particular organizational goals as well as objectives. As noted earlier, MNCs should provide their diverse workforces with CCC training. Their CCC training programs should be aimed at making individual MNC employees appreciate the behaviors, values, as well as elements of the cultures of their fellow employees. 
                            To ensure that the CCC training programs developed by or for MNCs are effective, they should meet particular standards. First, the CCC training programs ought to be designed in ways that meet the MNCs' business needs in varied countries. The programs' contents should be suitable for the MNCs' specific locations, responsibilities, positions, durations, skill requirements, target groups, and organizational goals (UNESCO 2-5). By and large, the programs may be tailor-made for top executives, managers, or employees of different cadres based in varied countries. The programs may be technical or foundational in their orientations.
                            Second, MNCs should pay attention to the CCC training programs' continuity. Ideally, the targeted groups should be taken through the programs until all the programs' objectives are realized. Ideally, the programs should not be discontinued, devoid of realizing their set objectives. Third, the MNCs should make certain that the programs meet the pre-set performance standards properly and satisfactorily – the programs should remain fit for use for all the durations they are in use. Fourth, the delivery of the programs ought to be proper – the performance standards set for the programs should be maintained throughout their execution. Lastly, the programs should be properly justified at all times. Notably, the programs can be put together and executed or run to make employees from diverse cultures aware or cognizant of different cultures' values and persuasions, to motivate the employees to participate in their workplace programs or to develop good working relationships with their colleagues regardless of their cultural backgrounds.

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">MNCs operate in a business space and world that is becoming increasingly interconnected. The increasing interconnectedness continues changing how MNCs and other businesses operate, including the diversity of their employees. MNC workplaces are becoming increasingly diverse and replete with employees and expatriates who find each other's cultural values odd or even unwelcome. Diversity has made CCC an increasingly vital element of MNCs' organizational success. Undoubtedly, effective communication is essential for MNCs' success, the industries the MNCs operate in notwithstanding. Given that MNCs have employees from different cultural backgrounds, having the employees go through CCC training helps them develop a good appreciation of what they need to communicate with their colleagues from other cultures effectively. CCC training helps MNC employees to appreciate the varied cultural dynamics that impact their interactions with their colleagues from different cultural backgrounds. From the research, it was clear that as regards MNCs, communicating across different cultures is quite challenging and that those working for MNCs should get the required CCC training.
